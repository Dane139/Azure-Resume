# Azure-Resume
My azure resume, following the ACG project video.


Started by having to generate a new ssh key. Having never used github or git before I had to refer to resource on how to do it. Pretty simple.

These 2 links helped me get that set up:
https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent
